# caineandrebekah.com

This project includes much of the stack for the caineandrebekah.com website.

www.caineandrebekah.com

I currently use the following languages, platforms, and resources:

- The website is hosted using Google Firebase.

- For the front end stack, I use Jquery, Javascript, and raw markup.

- The back end stack consists of node.js, including express.

- The stack for the database includes the Firebase realtime database and cloud firestore.
