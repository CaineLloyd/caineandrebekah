    <h1>Hello My Love</h1>
    <p>I wanted to remind you how much <b>I love you</b>. I know we are tired, and I know you feel weak.</p>
    <p>I hope to always let you know how much you mean to me. I still can't believe you're my wife, my <b>loyal and true</b>.</p>
    <p>You deserve nothing but <b>the best</b>, for that is what you give the world, and what you give to me.</p>
    <p><b>You are beautiful</b>, like a powerful gem, you shine and glow, lighting up the dark around you.</p>
    <p>Make me yours, as I promise to never be anyone elses. <b>I need you Rebekah</b>, I love you.</p>
    <p>-- Caine</p>
